<h1 id="version-310---sauna">Version 3.1.0 - ‘Sauna’</h1>
<p><em>23rd Jan, 2018</em>
  <a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v3.1.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>The major feature of this release is that it brings v3 functionality to
Windows. Windows now supports all the good stuff listed alongside
<code>v3.0.x</code> including <code>live_audio</code>, <code>midi</code>, <code>osc</code> and much more. See
<code>v3.0.1</code> and <code>v3.0.0</code> release notes below for more infomation.</p>

<p>Of course, no new release comes without new features, and there are a
number of additions and improvements on all levels. Firstly, we are
honoured to include a number of wonderful new samples kindly recorded
and released into the public domain by our friends Mehackit. If you
aren’t already aware, Mehackit organise and run creative coding
workshops all around Finland and Europe and were a core part behind the
CodeBus Africa project which used Sonic Pi to engage almost 2000 African
students with creative code. Our favourite of these samples is the new
<code>:ambi_sauna</code> which has given us the name for this release.</p>

<p>We have added support for Ogg Vorbis encoded audio files <code>.ogg</code> and
<code>.oga</code>. These are lossy encoders similar to <code>.MP3</code> but free from license
restrictions. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis</p>

<p>Another notable addition is the increase in translation coverage across
a number of languages. If you still feel the translation for your
language could be improved, please do consider joining in the
crowd-sourced effort here: <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/sonic-pi">https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/sonic-pi</a>/</p>

<p>We have also included some styling tweaks to the GUI - to make
it look even cleaner and also work better when projecting code with
visuals underneath.</p>

<p>Finally, this release also gives me the opportunity to welcome Ethan
Crawford to the Core Team. He has been a prolific contributor to the
project over the years and his keen eye for detail has helped polish
Sonic Pi from the rough stone it once was to the shining gem it is
today.</p>

<p>Have fun and enjoy the new features - especially you lovely Windows
users!</p>

<h1id="version-301---ioio">Version 3.0.1 - ‘IOIO’</h1>
<p><em>28th July, 2017</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v3.0.1">(view commits)</a>:</p>

<p>This is a minor release addressing a few bugs and includes a small
number of modifications.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-1">Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi only - based on a request from Raspberry Pi we have
removed the ability to switch between HDMI and headphone output as
this is now duplicate functionality to what is now available in
PIXEL. Now, to change audio output, you need to right-click on the
audio logo in the menu at the top right of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-1">GUI</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The IO menu has been slightly tweaked to improve amount of space used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Time State system no longer maintains a history of <em>all</em> events -
instead it retains at least 20 events for each path and beyond that
culls events 30s in the past.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-1">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fix minor issues with docs (grammar and rendering).</li>
  <li>Incoming OSC now correctly handles OSC paths which contain capital letters.</li>
</ul>




<p><a name="v3.0"></a></p>

<h1 id="version-30---io">Version 3.0 - ‘IO’</h1>

<p><em>18th July, 2017</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v3.0">(view commits)</a>:</p>

<p>This release is our most ambitious to date. The goal is to open up the
code within Sonic Pi to the outside world. We want you to be able to both
manipulate the real world to change the code and change the real world
with the code. Input Output. IO.</p>

<p>We have therefore focussed on getting events and audio in and out of
Sonic Pi in new ways whilst keeping to our philosophy of simple code,
live manipulation, and strict, powerful timing. This release introduces
a number of brand-new components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Time State</em> - a powerful new time-based deterministic shared memory system</li>
  <li><em>MIDI</em> - support for input and output of MIDI </li>
  <li><em>OSC</em> - support for sending and receiving OSC messages on the network.</li>
  <li><em>Live Audio</em> - for getting multiple streams of audio into Sonic Pi</li>
  <li><em>Multi-channel audio out</em> - for outputting multiple streams of audio.</li>
  <li><em>Audio Buffers</em> - for internal recording of audio enabling the creation of loopers.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to mention that MIDI and OSC output functionality is
possible due to a new well-timed scheduler. This was built in a
remarkable programming language called <a href="http://erlang.org">Erlang</a> which
is now part of the Sonic Pi distribution. We have had the great honour
of one of Erlang’s co-creators, Joe Armstrong working directly with us
on the implementation of this scheduler and we look forward immensely to
continuing to work with him on new functionality.</p>

<p>Another very important part of this release is the addition of Robin
Newman to the core team. We have always been consistently impressed with
his fearless and experimental attitude - pushing Sonic Pi into new areas
with ease. We’re excited that he’s decided to join our core team and
hope you’re as excited by his future work with us as we are.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re really very excited about what new kinds of instruments
people will be able to create with this new technology both in the
classroom and on stage at musical festivals. Sonic Pi has now become a
fully programmable music studio. Have fun live coding!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-2">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ring’s <code>.pick</code> now returns 1 element by default. Previously calling <code>.pick</code> on a ring would pick n elements randomly from the ring (including duplicate picks) where n would be the size of the ring. With this change, <code>.pick</code> only returns a single element. This makes it similar to choose.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-1">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>midi_*</code> - many new MIDI-specific fns such as <code>midi_note_on</code>, <code>midi_pitch_bend</code>, <code>midi_cc</code>, <code>midi_clock_tick</code>. See new tutorial section for more information. These fns <em>send</em> MIDI messages to connected MIDI devices. Incoming MIDI is received via the new event log.</li>
  <li><code>with_swing</code> - add swing to successive calls to do/end block.</li>
  <li><code>get</code> - get a named value from the Time State at the current time. This will return the last value entered. Previous values can be read when within a <code>time_warp</code>. Has full support for OSC </li>
  <li><code>set</code> - set a named value in the Time State at the current time. Future values can be set when within a <code>time_warp</code>.</li>
  <li><code>use_real_time</code> - convenience fn for setting the schedule ahead time to 0 for the current thread. Very useful for removing latency from live loops that are working with external cues (such as MIDI or OSC).</li>
  <li>
    <p><code>use_midi_defaults</code> - set defaults to be used for all subsequent MIDI calls. Similar to <code>use_synth_defaults</code>. Also available: <code>with_midi_defaults</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>use_osc</code> - set the default hostname and port number for subsequent outgoing OSC messages. See also <code>with_osc</code>.</li>
  <li><code>osc</code> - send Open Sound Control messages in time with the music to default hostname and port</li>
  <li><code>osc_send</code> - similar to <code>osc</code> but requires you to specify the hostname and port</li>
  <li><code>use_sched_ahead_time</code> - set the schedule ahead time specifically for the current thread. Also available - <code>with_sched_ahead_time</code>.</li>
  <li><code>current_time</code> - return the current logical time.</li>
  <li><code>assert_error</code> - An assertion to ensure the specified block of code raises the specified error.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New synth <code>live_audio</code> - directly stream audio from your soundcard as a synth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New FX <code>record</code> - enables you to internally record any audio into named buffers. Perfect for building looper systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>New FX <code>:sound_out</code> - stream out audio to a specific output on your sound card. This enables multi-channel audio out.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>:sound_out_stereo</code> - similar to <code>sound_out</code> but streams out to a pair of consecutive audio card (left and right) output channels.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>eq</code> - Parametric EQ with three centre freqs - low, mid &amp; high - all with Q values and gain (-1 -&gt; 1). Also has low and high shelves with centre freqs and slope adjustment.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>tremolo</code> - simple tremolo effect which modulates the volume within the <code>do/end</code> block.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-2">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New ‘pro’ icon set for performances.</li>
  <li>New GUI translations for the following languages: (BS) Bosnian, (CA) Catalan, (CS) Czech, (DA) Danish, (EL) Greek, (ET) Estonian, (HI) Hindi, (ID) Indonesian, (KO) Korean, (PT) Portuguese, (TR) Turkish, (ZH) Chinese</li>
  <li>Added new pane for displaying new cue events (including incoming OSC and MIDI)</li>
  <li>Added new IO preferences tab for configuring MIDI and network settings.</li>
  <li>Automatically autocomplete <code>sync</code>, <code>cue</code> and <code>get</code> or <code>set</code></li>
  <li>Increase width of autocompletion popup.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation--examples">Documentation &amp; Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New articles on additive and subtractive synthesis techniques.</li>
  <li>New example piece ‘Cloud Beat’ by Pit Noack</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-1">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Teach <code>time_warp</code> about input ranges. It now works similar to <code>at</code> in that it can now take two lists of args - times and values - which represent a list of time destinations to be visited in turn.</li>
  <li>Ensure any unprinted messages are displayed if an exception occurs.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>range</code> to work as expected with both floats and ints.</li>
  <li>Teach rings a new chain method - <code>.scale</code> which will return a new ring with all elements multiplied by the scale value.</li>
  <li>The fn <code>control</code> now returns the node you’re controlling.</li>
  <li>Add many new chords</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-2">Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix randomisation aspects of <code>:slicer</code>, <code>:wobble</code> and <code>:panslicer</code> FX (i.e. via the <code>probability:</code> opt).</li>
  <li>Fix file path drag and drop on Windows to not accidentally prefix path with /.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>chord_invert</code> and <code>sample</code> to work with floating point args.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="v2.11.1"></a></p>

<h1 id="version-2111---hack">Version 2.11.1 - ‘Hack’</h1>

<p><em>16th Dec, 2016</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.11.1">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This is primarily a maintainance release containing a number of bug
fixes and minor tweaks. The feature set remains unchanged from <code>v2.11</code>.</p>

<p>One of the core bugs fixed in this release is an issue with the return
key within some Japanese layouts. Another important change is the
unification of the font on all platforms to
<a href="http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">Hack</a>. This is from the same family as
Menlo and Bitstream Vera (the previous fonts for Mac and Linux
respectively) and a dramatic improvement to the Courier font previously
used for Windows.</p>

<h2 id="gui-3">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Move all platforms to the same font -
<a href="http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">Hack</a>.</li>
  <li>Improve initial log information and messages.</li>
  <li>The scope axes are no longer shown by default for a cleaner look and
feel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="docs">Docs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add new MagPi article on sample stretching.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-3">Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure <code>chord_invert</code>’s shift value is a whole number - otherwise it
is possible to get into an infinite recursion.</li>
  <li>Ensure thread locals have correct default values on <code>clear</code>. When a
run is created, the thread is given a set of default thread
locals. Previously <code>clear</code> removed <em>all</em> thread locals. Now, we reset
the thread locals to the defaults for a brand new thread.</li>
  <li>Fix line reported on syntax error.</li>
  <li>Fix unknown synth error message.</li>
  <li><code>sync</code> can once again handle multiple cues correctly.</li>
  <li>Fix boot issues for users that don’t have a standard /etc/hosts file
that contains an entry for localhost.</li>
  <li><code>sample_duration</code> now handles onsets, slices and sustain.</li>
  <li>Fix issue with return key not being recognised with Japanese
keyboards.</li>
  <li>Fix sporadic flickering of current line on Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li>Fix errors in buffer 0 being reported as being from buffer 3.</li>
  <li>Fix scrollbar background colour on Windows in dark mode.</li>
  <li>Improve error message reported when required ports are not available
at boot.</li>
  <li>Fix issue with calling <code>control</code> on a chord group.  </li>
  <li>Fix <code>rand</code> and <code>rand_i</code> to honour their arguments.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="version-211---time-warp">Version 2.11 - ‘Time Warp’</h1>

<p><em>3rd Nov, 2016</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.11.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This release is the biggest and most adventurous release yet. There are
as many (invisible) modifications and improvements to the internal
systems as there are new external features that you can see and play
with. The aim was to create a solid foundation for new and exciting
features both in this release and in preparation for future releases.</p>

<p>We also open our arms to welcome two new Core Team members - Luis Lloret
and Adrian Cheater. Both have made generous and substantial
contributions to this release. Thank-you. Sadly we also say farewell to
Jeremy Weatherford. Please extend your kind thoughts and gratitude to
Jeremy for all of his contributions - in particular for turning the
Windows release from a possibility into a reality. Luckily Luis has
kindly stepped in to maintain the Windows installer.</p>

<p>The main visible feature is the new scope visualisers. The overall audio
output can now be visually monitored by one of three wave form
visualisers. Firstly there is the individual left and right channels,
next is a single mono scope which is mixed down from the stereo channels
using RMS and finally there is a Lissajous scope which displays phase
differences between the left and right channels. Typically the mono
output will be most useful. Use the preferences pane to hide and show
each of these scopes. All of them may be viewed at the same time if
necessary. Thanks to Adrian Cheater for the core work behind this
feature.</p>

<p>We now have support for multi-channel input (up to 16 channels) via the
new <code>sound_in*</code> synths for systems that have audio in. This opens up the
possibility to use Sonic Pi as an FX unit for vocals, guitars and any
other audio source.</p>

<p>Another exciting new feature is the sample opt <code>onset:</code> - which lets you
play a specific percussive part of a sample. This uses an automatic
onset detection algorithm to determine all the points in the sample that
go from quiet to loud quickly such as a drum, synth or bass hit. For
example, this allows you to take a complex drum sample and trigger each
of the individual drums in your own order and to your own timing.</p>

<p>Finally, translations are now crowd-sourced and small or large
contributions for any language can be made here:
<code>https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/sonic-pi/</code>. If your language isn’t
yet available or you would like to improve things, please join in the
effort. Thanks to Hanno Zulla for making this possible.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-3">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>sample</code> now supports the opt <code>path:</code> which enables the sample’s path
to be overridden.</li>
  <li><code>use_sample_pack</code> is now deprecated and no longer available. Consider
using the new filter system. See documentation for <code>sample</code> for more
details.</li>
  <li><code>current_sample_pack</code> is now deprecated and no longer available.</li>
  <li><code>inspect</code> has been removed. (Standard printing now calls
<code>Object#inspect</code> by default)</li>
  <li><code>load_sample</code> now only loads the first matched sample. <code>load_samples</code>
now loads all matched samples.</li>
  <li>Remove SuperCollider server automatic reboot system as it was badly
conflicting with machines that went into a ‘sleep state’ (for example,
when a laptop is closed). The fn <code>reboot</code> is still supported and may
still be triggered manually if required.</li>
  <li>Calls to <code>play</code>, <code>synth</code> and <code>sample</code> now consume all their arguments
before testing to see if the synth should be triggered. This ensures
all declared rands are consumed. This change might therefore
potentially modify your random stream consumption. Consider using
<code>rand_back</code> or <code>rand_skip</code> to re-align the stream if necessary.</li>
  <li>New threads now start with a fresh set of tick counters and a new
random stream.</li>
  <li>It is no longer possible to use lambdas as values for synth
defaults. This is because synth defaults are shared across thread
boundaries and there is now a new safety system that only allows
immutable/serialisable values to be used. Unfortunately Ruby has no
notion of a ‘pure’ function and each lambda captures over its
environment and therefore may contain free variables pointing to
mutable data. A replacement system for describing a simple set of pure
functions is being designed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-2">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>reset</code> - resets the user’s thread locals (such as ticks and rand
stream index) to the snapshot of the state as recorded at the start of
the current thread.</li>
  <li><code>clear</code> - clears all the user’s thread locals to a blank state.</li>
  <li><code>time_warp</code>- allows whole blocks of code to be shifted forward or
backwards in time up to the value of <code>current_sched_ahead_time</code>.</li>
  <li><code>rand_look</code> - generate a random number without consuming a rand by
looking ahead in the random stream.</li>
  <li><code>rand_i_look</code> - generate a random integer without consuming a rand by
looking ahead in the random stream.</li>
  <li><code>run_file</code> - Runs the contents of file at path as if it was in the
current buffer.</li>
  <li><code>run_code</code> - Runs the contents of the specified string as if it was in
the current buffer.</li>
  <li><code>Numeric#clamp</code> - max and minimum bound (will clamp self to a value &lt;=
other and &gt;= -1*other</li>
  <li><code>set_recording_bit_depth!</code> - set the bit depth for WAV files generated
by recording the audio. Default is 16 bits, and can now be set to one
of 8, 16, 24 and 32. Larger bit depths will result in better quality
audio files but also much larger file sizes for the same duration.</li>
  <li><code>scsynth_info</code> - obtain information about the running audio synthesis
server SuperCollider such as the number of available busses and
buffers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-1">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New synth <code>:tech_saws</code> - an implementation of a slightly modified
supersaw.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:sound_in</code> - reads audio from the sound card.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:sound_in_stereo</code> - reads audio from the sound card.</li>
  <li>All FX now have a <code>pre_mix:</code> opt. This allows the audio flow to
completely bypass a given FX (unlike <code>mix:</code> which passes the audio
through the FX but modifies the amplitude afterwards).</li>
  <li>Teach <code>control</code> to manipulate the last triggered synth by default. For
example, <code>control amp: 3</code> will set the <code>amp:</code> opt of the last
triggered synth to 3. However, <code>control foo, amp: 3</code> will still
specifically control synth <code>foo</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="samples-1">Samples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New opt <code>slice:</code> - lets you play a specific slice of a sample. The
default number of slices is 16 which may be changed with the
<code>num_slices:</code> opt. Sample is divided equally into the number of slices
without regard for audio content and onset points.  The <code>slice:</code> opt
also works with <code>pick</code> for triggering random sample slices: <code>sample
:loop_amen, slice: pick</code>.</li>
  <li>New opt <code>onset:</code> - lets you play a specific percussive part of a
sample. Uses automatic onset detection to determine the points in the
sample that go from quiet to loud quickly. Unlike <code>slice:</code>, <code>onset:</code>
does not necessarily divide a sample into equal onsets - some onsets
will be smaller or bigger than others and the number of onsets is
determined by the algorithm and isn’t known in advance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-4">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New scope visualisers.</li>
  <li>Allow files to be dragged from the OS into the text area. This inserts
the file/folder name as a string.</li>
  <li>GUI now remembers the last directory you saved or opened a file
to/from as the default location for next time.</li>
  <li>Swap align button for a scope button. Given that alignment now happens
automatically, a specific button seems somewhat redundant. Instead we
now have a button for toggling the visibility of the scope(s).</li>
  <li>Loading multiple samples simultaneously is now much faster.</li>
  <li>Preferences have been slightly re-organised.</li>
  <li>Preferences now has a Master volume slider which controls Sonic Pi’s
audio amplitude independently from the system volume.</li>
  <li>All buttons now display status message + shortcut where available.</li>
  <li>Enable app transparency slider for Windows.</li>
  <li>Dark and light theme colours have been slightly polished and unified
to use the same logic.</li>
  <li>On multi-screen systems, fullscreen mode now defaults to the app’s
current screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Translations are now crowd-sourced. See:
<code>https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/sonic-pi/</code></li>
  <li>Improve docstring for <code>live_loop</code>.</li>
  <li>Add 3 new MagPi articles on amplitude modulation, performance and practice techniques.</li>
  <li>Add missing <code>pulse_width:</code> opt to flanger FX doc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-2">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Improve log messages written to <code>~/.sonic-pi/log</code></li>
  <li>Improve booting on Mac in the case that the audio card’s rate can’t be
determined.</li>
  <li>Massively improve boot stability on Windows.</li>
  <li>Improve error message for <code>play_chord</code> when notes isn’t list like.</li>
  <li>The number of samples that may be loaded at any one time has been
increased from 1000 to 4000. However, memory limitations still apply
(4000 1MB samples will require 4000MB of free system memory)</li>
  <li><code>pick</code> now returns a lambda if no list is given as the first argument
(which makes it useful for using with sample’s <code>onset:</code> and <code>slice:</code>
opts.</li>
  <li>Audio server is now paused when app is not in use - reducing CPU load
and battery consumption.</li>
  <li>Error messages now report names matching the editor tabs such as <code>buffer 0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-4">Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Decrease duration of <code>:loop_tabla</code> so that it correctly loops. (Length
reduced to 10.674 seconds).</li>
  <li>Enforce UTF-8 encoding of all incoming text.</li>
  <li>Fix <code>:reverb</code> FX’s <code>mix:</code> opt to ensure it’s in the range 0 to 1.</li>
  <li><code>sample nil</code> now no longer plays a sample - it was incorrectly
defaulting to the first built-in sample (<code>:ambi_choir</code>)</li>
  <li><code>pick</code>’s <code>skip:</code> opt now works as expected: <code>pick(5).drop(1) == pick(5, skip: 1)</code></li>
  <li><code>sample</code> now prints a ‘no sample found’ message with both <code>sample nil</code> and <code>sample []</code> rather than incorrectly playing the first built-in wav file.</li>
  <li>Limit <code>:piano</code> synth to notes less than 231 as higher values crash the audio server.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="version-210---cowbell">Version 2.10 - ‘Cowbell’</h1>

<p><em>Friday 15th April, 2016</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.10.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p><em>“I gotta have more cowbell!”</em> - The Bruce Dickinson</p>

<p>The main feature in this release is the completely new sample system for
working with large folders of samples. You can now easily index into and
filter over whole folders of samples with a simple yet powerful filter
system. This system has been in development for over a year now and has
been tuned and tweaked over many performances and practice sessions. See
the documentation and examples for <code>sample</code> as well as the new tutorial
section 3.7 for details.</p>

<p>We also have a number of exciting new sounds to play with including some
beautifully sounding chiptune synths, fun retro FX and new drum samples
including a full tabla set and a cowbell.</p>

<p>Finally, even more boot issues on both OS X and Windows have been
fixed, making this the most polished and stable release to date.</p>

<p>Now go and get your live code on!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-4">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>use_sample_pack_as</code> and <code>with_sample_pack_as</code> have been removed.</li>
  <li>A synth opt value of <code>nil</code> now no longer resolves to 0.0. Instead it
masks any defaults and ensures the downstream default (for the actual
synthdef itself) is honoured. This allows you to override any existing
synth defaults specified via <code>use_synth_defaults</code> for a given synth
trigger.</li>
  <li>Default schedule ahead time is now 0.5s on all platforms for
consistency (except for Raspberry Pi 1 which remains at 1s).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-3">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>current_random_seed</code> - Get the current seed value of the random generator.</li>
  <li><code>set_cent_tuning!</code> - global tuning.</li>
  <li><code>on</code> - similar to <code>if</code> but behaves the same as the <code>on:</code> opt for
synths and samples.</li>
  <li><code>halves</code> - create a ring of successive halves.</li>
  <li><code>doubles</code> - create a ring of successive doubles.</li>
  <li><code>pick</code> - similar to shuffle but allows duplicates. You may also
specify how many items to pick.</li>
  <li><code>fx_names</code> - create a ring of all available FX.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-2">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New synth <code>:dtri</code> - detuned triangle waves.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:pluck</code> - a lovely synthesised plucked string.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:chiplead</code> - retro NES style lead synth.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:chipbass</code> - retro NES style bass synth.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>:chipnoise</code> - retro NES style noise synth.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>:whammy</code> - low-tech transposition effect similar to the
Digitech Whammy guitar pedal.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>:octaver</code> - low-tech octave effect similar to early guitar
pedals.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>:vowel</code> - modifies incoming signal to match human vowel
sounds.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>:mono</code> - mono effect for summing stereo channels.</li>
  <li><code>:tanh</code> FX is now more crunchy by default.</li>
  <li><code>:compressor</code> and <code>:krush</code> FX now correctly honour the <code>mix:</code> opt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="samples-2">Samples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Samples in FLAC format (Free Lossless Audio Codec) are now supported!</li>
  <li>The <code>sample</code> fn gained source and filter pre-opts. You may now specify
a number of parameters directly before the opts which describe both
folders containing samples and filters over those folders to allow you
to easily and quickly work with large sample sets. See Section 3.7 of
the tutorial for more information.</li>
  <li>Samplers now have <code>hpf:</code> and <code>lpf:</code> opts. Any <code>cutoff:</code> opts are
automatically switched to <code>lpf:</code> and any errors will be reported with
an <code>lpf:</code> prefix.</li>
  <li>The sampler synth gained a compressor enabled via the <code>compress:</code>
opt. This means you can now compress any triggered sample directly
without the need to reach for an FX.</li>
  <li>Samplers gained the <code>pre_amp:</code> opt which applies the amp at the
beginning of its internal signal chain. You can use this to overload
the new compressor.</li>
  <li>Samplers now have both high pass and low pass filter envelopes which
behave similarly to the amplitude envelope but control internal hpf
and lpf FX. These are available via new opts which mirror the standard
envelope opts but with a <code>hpf_</code> and <code>lpf_</code> prefix (such as
<code>hpf_attack</code>, <code>lpf_decay_level</code> and friends).</li>
  <li>Passing a directory path to <code>load_samples</code> will now load all the
samples within that directory.</li>
  <li>Passing a directory path to <code>free_samples</code> will now free all the
loaded samples within that directory.</li>
  <li>Samples are now loaded asynchronously in a separate thread. This
therefore doesn’t block the current thread and cause any subsequent
synth/sample triggers to be late.</li>
  <li>Sample trigger logging now includes the directory of the contained
sample.</li>
  <li>Samples are now reloaded asynchronously after a server reboot (and
therefore no longer block execution).</li>
  <li>Add new <code>:tabla_</code> sample group with a range of tabla drum sounds.</li>
  <li>Add new <code>:vinyl_</code> sample group with a range of vinyl scratches and
hisses.</li>
  <li>Add new samples: <code>:drum_cowbell</code>, <code>:drum_roll</code>, <code>:misc_crow</code>,
<code>:misc_cineboom</code>, <code>:perc_swash</code>, <code>:perc_till</code>, <code>:loop_safari</code>,
<code>:loop_tabla</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-5">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add new preference to enforce strict synth/FX timing. When enabled
synths and samples no longer trigger if it is too late - instead they
are silent and print a warning message. This behaviour ensures samples
or synths are never triggered out of time.</li>
  <li>New load button which will load the contents of a file into the
current buffer.</li>
  <li>The vertical bars which help visualise nesting now render in a
contiguous fashion over blank lines.</li>
  <li><code>C-k</code> now nukes over trailing whitespace.</li>
  <li><code>load_sample</code> now has sample autocompletion.</li>
  <li>GUI now correctly reports if the host is a Raspberry Pi 3.</li>
  <li>New editor preference - Log Auto Scroll. When enabled will always
scroll log to the bottom after printing every new message.</li>
  <li>Whitespace at top and bottom of buffer is no longer trimmed.</li>
  <li>Hitting <code>RETURN</code> now auto-indents the buffer - ensuring that the
cursor is moved to the correct indentation on the following line.</li>
  <li>Added Chinese Simplified GUI translation.</li>
  <li>Log visibility now correctly matches GUI preference.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation-1">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New tutorial section 3.7 on Sample Pack Filters.</li>
  <li>New appendix sections.</li>
  <li>Examples for <code>sample</code> fn have been completely rewritten and extended.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-3">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>scale</code> and <code>chord</code> can now handle being passed no tonic such as:
<code>(chord :minor)</code> which will return a ring of offsets from 0.</li>
  <li><code>chord</code> learned new variants: <code>add2</code>, <code>add4</code>, <code>add9</code>, <code>add11</code>,
<code>add13</code>, <code>madd2</code>, <code>madd4</code>, <code>madd9</code>, <code>madd11</code>, <code>madd13</code></li>
  <li>The ring’s <code>.take</code> method can now take more elements than the original
ring by wrapping around:
<code>(ring 1, 2, 3).take(5) #=&gt; (ring 1, 2, 3, 1, 2)</code></li>
  <li>Rings may now be added or subtracted from each other e.g.
<code>(ring 1, 2,  3) + (ring 4) #=&gt; (ring 1, 2, 3, 4)</code></li>
  <li>Adding or subtracting a number from a ring will create a new ring with
the number added or subtracted from each of the original ring’s
elements: <code>(ring 1, 2, 3) - 1 #=&gt; (ring 0.0, 1.0, 2.0)</code></li>
  <li>Calling <code>(ring 1, 2, 3).take(0)</code> will now return an empty ring.</li>
  <li><code>density</code> now complains if it isn’t passed a do/end block.</li>
  <li>Improve error messages for <code>use/with_synth</code> when accidentally passed opts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-5">Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On OS X only raise an error on boot if it’s clear the sound card’s in
and out rates are different.</li>
  <li>Improve robustness of boot process on Windows.</li>
  <li>Rest notes are no longer printed if synth logging is disabled.</li>
  <li>No longer apply synth defaults to FX.</li>
  <li>You may now control opts that have no associated info (previously it
would raise a ‘not modulatable’ error).</li>
  <li>Fix index lookup of Vectors.</li>
  <li>Fix <code>C-i</code> doc lookup shortcut to work with <code>:tb303</code> synth docs.</li>
  <li><code>C-i</code> now always displays docs where available (previously it was
possible for docs not to be displayed).</li>
  <li>Sliding between chords now works correctly  </li>
  <li>Windows version will now boot on mutiple networked machines logged in
with the same account.</li>

<h1 id="version-29---venster">Version 2.9 - ‘Venster’</h1>

<p><em>Thursday 31st December, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.9.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>Hot on the heels of the previous release comes <code>v2.9</code> codenamed
<code>Venster</code> (Dutch for window). This release has a specific focus on
fixing all the known issues with Sonic Pi running on Windows. If you’ve
tried Sonic Pi on Windows before and had issues, make sure to try it
again with <code>v2.9</code>. If you’re still having issues on Windows please do
let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For all you Raspberry Pi and Mac OS X users - you’re not left out. Sonic
Pi is just as stable as it was before (if not more stable) and <code>v2.9</code>
comes with a surprising amount of tweaks and features for its short 1
month development cycle. There’s two new FX to play with: <code>tanh</code> and
<code>gverb</code> as well as a heavily revamped logging system which is much
clearer about printing which opts are actually being used for your
synths and samples. Finally, we now include of all the published MagPi
magazine articles in the tutorial. We also now have Hungarian and
Norwegian translations of the GUI.</p>

<p>Happy Live Coding!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-5">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Rename fn <code>invert_chord</code> to <code>chord_invert</code></li>
  <li>Sampler no longer mixes <code>rate:</code> and <code>pitch_stretch:</code> opts. It’s now
possible to set the <code>rate:</code> independent of the <code>pitch:</code> modification
caused by <code>pitch_stretch</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-4">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>block_duration</code> - returns the duration of the given block in seconds (not scaled with the BPM).</li>
  <li><code>block_slept?</code> - returns true if the contents of the block slept or synced.</li>
  <li><code>synth_names</code> - returns a list of all the available synths</li>
  <li><code>reset_mixer!</code> - resets the main mixer back to its default values.</li>
  <li><code>sample_free</code> - unload a sample from memory to free up memory usage.</li>
  <li><code>sample_free_all</code> - unload all samples from memory.</li>
  <li><code>use_octave</code> - similar to <code>use_transpose</code> but for whole octaves.</li>
  <li><code>with_octave</code> - similar to <code>with_transpose</code> but for whole octaves.</li>
  <li><code>use_merged_sample_defaults</code> - similar to <code>use_merged_synth_defaults</code>
but for samples</li>
  <li><code>with_merged_sample_defaults</code> - similar to
<code>with_merged_synth_defaults</code> but for samples</li>
  <li><code>use_cent_tuning</code> - uniformly tune all subsequent notes in cents</li>
  <li><code>with_cent_tuning</code> - uniformly tune all notes in cents within the block</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-3">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New FX <code>tanh</code> - for more distortion goodness.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>gverb</code> - a different reverb FX to play with.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-6">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Synths and samples now also log defaults set by <code>use_synth_defaults</code>
and friends.</li>
  <li>Opts are logged in the order they were defined with local opts first
followed by inherited opts. </li>
  <li>BPM scaling is now accounted for in logging vals.</li>
  <li>Log metadata such as run number and time is now printed in a more
code-like way: as a hash of key value pairs.</li>
  <li><code>C-k</code> will now kill multiple lines if lines end with <code>,</code>.</li>
  <li>When saving a buffer a <code>.txt</code> extension is automatically added to the
file name if none specified.</li>
  <li>Add Hungarian and Norwegian translations of GUI.</li>
  <li>Add Spanish translation of tutorial.</li>
  <li>Add title to main window - enables Sonic Pi to be selected in
screensharing app lists such as Google Hangouts and OBS.</li>
  <li>Add autocompletion for tuning systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation-2">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add 8 complete MagPi magazine articles to the tutorial in appendix A.</li>
  <li>Add new example ‘ambient experiment’ by Darin Wilson.</li>
  <li>Add new example ‘chord inversions’ by Adrian Cheater.</li>
  <li>Change tutorial license to CC-BY-SA 4.0.</li>
  <li>Add instructions for compiling and building on Windows.</li>
  <li>Many, many minor tweaks and improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-4">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>sync:</code> opt to <code>live_loop</code> and <code>in_thread</code>. This now syncs the
live loop once on creation. Similar to the <code>delay:</code> opt. If both
<code>sync:</code> and <code>delay:</code> are specified then the delay happens before the
sync.</li>
  <li>The <code>synth</code> fn can now play chords with the <code>notes:</code> opt such as:
<code>synth :dsaw, notes: (chord :e3, :minor)</code>. This will return a single

  <li>BPM scaling and other normalisation is now honoured when controlling nodes</li>
  <li>The <code>on:</code> opt is now honoured when playing chords.</li>
  <li>Samplers sound signal now bypasses filter envelope when not used.</li>
  <li>It is now possible to use externally defined FX synths by passing a
string as the FX name: <code>with_fx "my_shiny_effect"</code>. This needs to be
loaded manually via <code>load_synthdefs</code>.</li>

both audio in and out.</li>
  <li>Run code in <code>~/.sonic-pi/init.rb</code> on launch if it exists.  </li>
  <li>If environment variable <code>SONIC_PI_HOME</code> is set it will be used over
<code>~</code> as the root of the user’s <code>.sonic-pi</code> directory (used to auto-save
files and store logs).</li>
  <li>Default sound card selection is now honoured on Raspberry Pi - so you
may now use your IQaudIO hat (or similar) out of the box.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugfixes-6">Bugfixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix number of synth validation errors.</li>
  <li>Fix sporadically failing boot issues on Windows</li>
  <li>Add auto-reboot functionality for audio server. This now detects
errors in the server (such as a killed or zombied process) and
automatically reboots it to enable Sonic Pi to continue without a full
restart. Reboots automatically reload all loaded samples and
synthdefs.</li>
  <li><code>sample_duration</code> now correctly takes account of TL defaults set by
<code>use_sample_defaults</code>.</li>
  <li>Sampler opts <code>pitch_stretch</code>, <code>beat_stretch</code> and <code>rpitch</code> can now be
used in TL defaults.</li>

<h1 id="version-28---karlsruhe">Version 2.8 - ‘Karlsruhe’</h1>
<p><em>Friday 20th November, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.8.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This release, named after Karlsruhe, one of the home cities of live
coding, is mainly a maintenance release with a strong focus on both
performance, stability and documentation. This is therefore the fastest
and most stable release of Sonic Pi ever with a massive 10% performance
improvement on the original Raspberry Pi 1. It also ships with new
translations in Polish, Japanese and French. Many of these improvements
(such as the complete rewrite of the OSC stack) are not documented in
this release list but can instead be found in the commit logs over on
Github.</p>

<p>However, not to go unnoticed are a number of exciting new features. For
example we now have a new Band EQ FX, the ability to use MIDI note names
such as <code>:e5</code> as values for opts such as <code>cutoff:</code>, and new powerful
cutoff envelopes on the sampler.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-6">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shortcuts for switching buffers have changed. They are now <code>M-{</code> and
<code>M-}</code> for switching left and right respectively.</li>
  <li><code>sync</code> no longer inherits BPM by default. Set the <code>bpm_sync:</code> opt to
true to enable BPM inheritance.</li>
  <li>Random seed generation for new threads is now reset on calls to
<code>use_random_seed</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-5">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>octs</code> - returns a ring of successive octaves.</li>
  <li><code>assert</code> - for raising an exception if the argument is not true.</li>
  <li><code>assert_equal</code> - for raising an exception if the two arguments are not
equal.</li>
  <li><code>bt</code> - converts the specified time w.r.t. the current BPM.</li>
  <li><code>inspect</code> - similar to <code>print</code> but prints the inspected version of the argument.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-7">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New translations for Polish, Japanese and French.</li>
  <li>Improve efficiency of logging panel.</li>
  <li><code>M-RET</code> is now a duplicate shortcut for running the code.</li>
  <li>Log title bar is now hidden in full-screen mode.</li>
  <li>Log - don’t display └ or ├ if the line is blank, instead display │</li>
  <li>Add sample name autocompletion to more fns such as <code>sample_duration</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation-3">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New tutorial section on ring chains (chainable functions for modifying rings)</li>
  <li>Tilburg 2 example slightly tweaked for Raspberry Pi 1 compatibility.</li>
  <li>Many minor tweaks and improvements in all areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-4">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New FX - Band EQ for attenuating or boosting a specific frequency band.</li>
  <li>New synth - DPulse - a detuned pulse wave.</li>
  <li>Sampler now has a cutoff envelope which can be accessed via new opts
which mirror the standard envelope opts but with a <code>cutoff_</code> prefix
(such as <code>cutoff_attack</code>, <code>cutoff_decay_level</code> and friends).</li>
  <li>Sampler now correctly handles samples with different sample rates.</li>
  <li>Bitcrusher FX now has an internal low pass filter modifiable via a new <code>cutoff</code> opt.</li>
  <li>Panslicer now correctly honours min and max pan values.</li>
  <li>New default opt <code>on:</code> for both <code>sample</code> and <code>synth</code>. This acts like
<code>if</code> but ensures all the opt vals are evaluated (useful if wanting to
keep the consumption of random streams or ticks consistent even when
not triggering a synth.</li>
  <li>MIDI opts such as <code>cutoff:</code> can now accept note names such as <code>:c4</code>.</li>
  <li>FX learned the global <code>slide:</code> opt to match synths.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-5">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Massive performance improvements.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>play_pattern_timed</code> to handle rings.</li>
  <li><code>current_transpose</code> now returns 0 if there is no current

<h1 id="version-27---rerezzed">Version 2.7 - ‘Rerezzed’</h1>

<p><em>Thursday 10th September, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.7.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This release brings a substantial change to the random number
generator. This has the unfortunate side effect of breaking backwards
compatibility.  If you have been using <code>rand</code>, <code>choose</code>, <code>shuffle</code> and
friends to create predictable patterns for your riffs, your code will
produce different results in this release. Please let me apologise and
say it’s for a good cause. So what is this good cause?  Well, you can
now jump backwards and forwards through the random stream giving you way
more creative control than before! The random stream is now also unified
with the random stream on the synthesis server allowing you to sync
behaviour between synths and code. Exciting times.</p>

<p>The sampler has also been super charged. We can now easily change the
rate via MIDI note intervals with <code>rpitch:</code> and stretch the sample whilst
preserving pitch via <code>pitch_stretch:</code> (although with variable results
<code>;-)</code>).</p>

<p>Finally you can now control the global mixer with <code>set_mixer_control!</code>
for those full filter sweeps over the entire sound…</p>

<p>Have fun and happy live coding!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-7">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Complete rewrite of random number system. This means if you’ve been
combining calls to <code>use_random_seed</code> with randomisation to create
predictable melodies/rhythms/timbral manipulations you will
unfortunately get different results in <code>v2.7</code>. This change is to
synchronise both the Ruby rand stream with the one in SuperCollider as
well as enabling the reversal of calls to rand via <code>rand_back</code>.</li>
  <li><code>sync</code> now causes the BPM to be inherited from the thread calling the
matching <code>cue</code>. This may be disabled with the new <code>bpm_sync:</code> opt.</li>
  <li><code>rrand</code> and <code>rand</code> now return 0 if called with 0.</li>
  <li><code>invert_chord</code> now handles negative inversions in a more musically
appropriate manner..</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-6">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>ratio_to_pitch</code> which provides the inverse of <code>pitch_to_ratio</code></li>
  <li><code>midi_notes</code> - returns a ring of numbers (mapping the source
ring/array through the fn <code>note</code>).</li>
  <li><code>rand_back</code> - reverse the random stream and ‘undo’ calls to <code>rand</code></li>
  <li><code>rand_skip</code> - skip forward through the random stream.</li>
  <li><code>rand_reset</code>- reset the random stream to the last seed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-8">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is now possible to toggle the commenting of whole selections or
individual lines with the shortcut <code>M-/</code>.</li>
  <li>Added Icelandic translation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-5">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All synths learned the <code>decay_level</code> opt to allow the sustain phase to
shift between two distinct values. The default value for <code>decay_level</code>
is to mirror <code>sustain_level:</code> thus preserving current behaviour.</li>
  <li><code>play</code> and <code>synth</code> have now learned the <code>pitch:</code> opt to match
<code>sample</code>. This just increments or decrements the final note.</li>
  <li><code>sample</code> now correctly validates opts.</li>
  <li><code>sample</code> learned the <code>pitch_stretch:</code> opt which combines <code>rate:</code>
modification (similar to <code>beat_stretch:</code> with <code>pitch:</code>. Attempts to
maintain the pitch whilst simultaneously changing the rate. The
underlying implementation is very basic and can easily destroy the
sound.</li>
  <li><code>sample</code> learned the <code>rpitch:</code> opt for simple rate pitch
modulation. This modifies the rate to match the specified number of
MIDI notes relative from the current pitch. For example, a <code>rpitch:</code>
of 12 would double the rate.</li>
  <li>The unit of the FX <code>:echo</code>’s <code>decay:</code> opt is now beats and the value
is scaled with the BPM.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Most examples have been tweaked to sound good with the new random
generator. </li>
  <li>Tilburg has been replaced with Tilburg 2. Play it and get your
Algorave on!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-6">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Auto-align code on Run.</li>
  <li><code>live_loop</code> learned the <code>seed:</code> opt which will set the new thread with
the specified seed prior to initial run.</li>
  <li>Add check to ensure BPM is a positive value.</li>
  <li><code>density</code> has now been taught to handle values between 0 and 1 which
will now stretch time for the specified block.</li>
  <li>Errors now no longer print out crazy print version of context object
i.e. #<sonicpispideruser1:0x007fc82e1f79a0></sonicpispideruser1:0x007fc82e1f79a0></li>
  <li>Both <code>in_thread</code> and <code>live_loop</code> have now learned the <code>delay:</code> opt
which will delay the initial execution by the specified number of
beats.</li>
  <li>Buffer and thread name are now printed on error.  </li>
  <li><code>sample_duration</code> now understands all the opts that you can pass to <code>sample</code>  </li>
  <li>It is now possible to do basic arithmetic on symbols representing
rests: <code>:r + 3</code> returns <code>:r</code> (a rest plus any MIDI note shift is still
a rest).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-1">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed crash when synth args were specified as Rationals.  </li>
  <li><code>note_info</code> now correctly handles octaves.</li>
  <li>Fix windows paste shortcut <code>C-v</code>.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>invert_chord</code> how to properly handle out of range index ranges.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="version-26---algorave">Version 2.6 - ‘Algorave’</h1>

<p><em>Thursday 30th July, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.6.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>The laser beams sliced through the wafts of smoke as the subwoofer
pumped bass deep into the bodies of the crowd. The atmosphere was ripe
with a heady mix of synths and dancing. However something wasn’t quite
right in this nightclub. Projected in bright colours above the DJ booth
was futuristic text, moving, dancing, flashing. This wasn’t fancy
visuals, it was merely a projection of Sonic Pi running on a Raspberry
Pi. The occupant of the DJ booth wasn’t spinning disks or playing MP3s,
she was writing, editing and evaluating code. She was <em>live coding</em> and
this was an <a href="http://twitter.com/algorave">Algorave</a>.</p>

<p>This release is codenamed <a href="http://twitter.com/algorave">Algorave</a> to
celebrate that Sonic Pi is now ready to be performed within nightclubs
as well as still being a fantastic tool for learning how to code
creatively. There are many improvements as detailed below. However,
let’s just take a brief look at some of the most fun. Firstly we have
the new error reporting system to make it easier to find and debug your
errors. Syntax errors are now blue and runtime errors pink. We also have
a new look and feel including a new dark mode for performing in dark
places. We also have some fantastic new synths, FX and have even
improved the standard synths. For example, <code>sample</code> now lets you stretch
to match the beat with the <code>beat_stretch:</code> opt and change pitch with
<code>pitch:</code>. The <code>slicer</code> FX now sports a fantastic deterministic
<code>probability:</code> opt for creating and manipulating rhythmic structures
with ease. Finally there’s the new thread local <code>tick</code>/<code>look</code> system
which will revolutionise the way you work with <code>ring</code>s within
<code>live_loop</code>s. Of course there’s so much more too!</p>

<p>Enjoy this release and happy <a href="http://algorave.com">Algoraving!</a></p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-8">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>res:</code> opt for all synths and FX now has range 0-&gt;1 rather than
1-&gt;0. This means that a higher res value results in more
resonance. This will hopefully be more intuitive to beginners and less
surprising for people with existing synth knowledge.</li>
  <li>The fn <code>stop</code> has been renamed to <code>kill</code> for killing specific
synths. In its place a new fn <code>stop</code> has been added to stop a given
thread or <code>live_loop</code>.</li>
  <li><code>invert_wave</code> opts are now inverted. The default is now 0 which
has the same behaviour as the old 1.  This means that it’s more
intuitive to use the opt as to invert the current wave, you now
specify: <code>invert_wave: true</code>, rather than <code>invert_wave: false</code>. This
shouldn’t affect any code which doesn’t explicitly set the <code>invert_wave:</code>
opt. Pieces which have explicit inversion need to swap all 0s for 1s
and vice versa.</li>
  <li>The <code>res:</code> opt for <code>rrand</code> and <code>rdist</code> has been renamed to <code>step:</code> to
avoid confusion with the resonance opt for cutoff filters.</li>
  <li>Rename <code>pitch_ratio</code> to <code>pitch_to_ratio</code> to keep in line with other
similar fns such as <code>midi_to_hz</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-fns-7">New Fns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New thread-local (i.e. live_loop local) counter system via fns <code>tick</code>
and <code>look</code>.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>vector</code> which creates a new kind of Array - an immutable
vector (<code>SPVector</code>) which is now the default base class for all rings.</li>
  <li>New fns <code>use_sample_defaults</code> and <code>with_sample_defaults</code> which act
similarly as their <code>*_synth_defaults</code> counterparts but for samples not
synths.</li>
  <li>New fns <code>use_tuning</code> and <code>with_tuning</code> for exploring other tuning
systems such as <code>:just</code>, <code>:pythagorean</code>, and <code>:meantone</code>.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>invert_chord</code> for chord inversions.  </li>
  <li>New fn <code>current_beat_duration</code> for returning the duration of the
current beat in seconds.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>note_range</code> for returning a range of notes between two notes
with a <code>pitches:</code> opt for constraining the choice of filler notes.</li>
  <li>New fns <code>scale_names</code> and <code>chord_names</code> for returning a ring of all
chords and scales.</li>
  <li>New example <code>rerezzed</code> - strongly influenced by Daft Punk’s track
<code>derezzed</code>.</li>
  <li>New example <code>reich phase</code> - a nice way of combining <code>live_loop</code>s and
<code>tick</code> to create sophisticated polyrhythms.</li>
  <li>New fns <code>use_cue_logging</code> and <code>with_cue_logging</code> for enabling and
disabling the logging of <code>cue</code> messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-9">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New visual look and feel including a new Dark Mode for live coding in
night clubs.</li>
  <li>New preferences for hiding/showing aspects of the GUI such as the
buttons, log, tabs etc.</li>
  <li>New preference for full screen mode.</li>
  <li>Improve error message reporting. Syntax errors are now made distinct
from runtime errors with colour-coded messages. Also, the line number
of the error is much more visible, and the line of the error is
highlighted with an arrow in the left-hand margin.</li>
  <li>Workspaces are now named buffers. This is a smaller word which works
better on lower res screens and is also a lovely term used by a number
of wonderful programming editors such as Emacs.</li>
  <li>Print friendly messages to the log on boot.  </li>
  <li>Add pref option to check for updates now.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-6">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New FX - <code>krush</code> for krushing the sound.</li>
  <li>New FX - <code>panslicer</code> similar to <code>slicer</code> and <code>wobble</code> but modulates
the stereo panning of the audio.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>subpulse</code> for a full range pulse with extra bass.</li>
  <li>New synth <code>blade</code> - a moody Blade Runner-esque synth violin</li>
  <li>New synth <code>piano</code> - a basic piano emulation. Only capable of whole notes.</li>
  <li>FXs <code>slicer</code> and <code>wobble</code> now have a wonderful new <code>probability:</code> opt
which will only slice on (or off depending on wave inversion) with the
specified probability. The behaviour is deterministic, so repeated
calls with the same <code>seed:</code> and <code>probability:</code> opts will result in the
same behaviour. Great for adding interesting rhythmic variation to
sound.</li>
  <li>FXs <code>slicer</code> and <code>wobble</code> now have smoothing opts for even more
control over the resulting wave form.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>sample</code> the opt <code>beat_stretch:</code> for modifying the rate of the
sample to make sure the duration of the sample is n beats long (with
respect to the current bpm). Note: stretching the beat <em>does</em> change
the pitch.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>sample</code> the opt <code>pitch</code> to enable pitch shifting on any sample.  </li>
  <li>FX <code>flanger</code>’s feedback mixing is now more fair and is less likely to
hike up the amplitude.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-7">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Teach <code>note_info</code> to also handle a number as its param.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>factor?</code> to handle division by 0.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>load_sample</code> to throw exception when passed an empty path.</li>
  <li>Now throws an exception when you attempt to create an empty ring.</li>
  <li>Rings are now immutable (in the Clojure sense) which means they can be
safely passed to multiple threads/live_loops without any issues.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>use_sample_bpm</code> the opt <code>num_beats:</code> to indicate that a given
sample consists of a specific number of beats.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>comment</code> and <code>uncomment</code> to require blocks.  </li>
  <li>Teach synth chord groups to allow their notes to be controlled
individually to allow transitions between chords.</li>
  <li>Throw nicer exception when unable to normalise synth args  </li>
  <li>Teach <code>chord</code> the new opt <code>invert:</code> as a shortcut to the new
<code>invert_chord</code> fn.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>sample_duration</code> about the opts <code>start:</code> and <code>finish:</code> and
envelope opts such as <code>attack:</code> and <code>release:</code>. This allows you to
replace any call to <code>sample</code> with <code>sample_duration</code> to get the exact
duration of that call.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>chord</code> the opt <code>num_octaves</code> to enable the easy creation of
arpeggios.</li>
  <li>It is now possible to set the block type in the Minecraft API.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-2">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix bug in <code>with_sample_pack_as</code> to now correctly accept a block.</li>
  <li><code>mc_surface_teleport</code> no longer throws an error.</li>
  <li><code>Array#shuffle</code> now works correctly with the random seeds for
deterministic behaviour.</li>
  <li>Fix broken behaviour with multiple nested calls to <code>*_sample_bpm</code>.</li>

<p><em>Monday 13th April, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.5.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This release comes with support for
<a href="http://pi.minecraft.net">Minecraft: Pi Edition</a> installed on the
Raspberry Pi. You can now create music with Minecraft visuals or even
code up a synth score in Minecraft blocks and read and play the score
from Sonic Pi! Another exciting aspect of this release is much improved
editor functionality for navigating around and manipulating code via
keyboard shortcuts. This means that live coding just got a lot more
fun. The keyboard shortcuts are based on the standard shortcuts provided
by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> - the oldest and
most powerful text editor in use by wizard programmers today.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-9">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>invert_wave</code> now defaults to 1 everywhere. I found I always inverted
 the wave every time I used a synth/fx where wave inversion was
 key. This seemed like such a better default I’ve broken compatibility
 for it. Apologies if this has affected you.</li>
  <li>The <code>flanger</code> FX now defaults the optional arg <code>stereo_invert_wave</code> to
1.</li>
  <li>Renamed FX <code>ring</code> to <code>ring_mod</code> to reduce the potential for confusion
with the <code>ring</code> datastructure.</li>
  <li><code>Tab</code> now indents current line or selection rather than inserting a
useless tab character.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new">New</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Support for programming <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net">Minecraft Pi Edition</a>.</li>
  <li><code>sync</code> now accepts multiple cue ids and will sync on the first matching id.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>pitch_ratio</code> for converting a midi note to a frequency
ratio. Useful for tuning samples.</li>

number of slices.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>spark</code> for displaying lists of numbers in a fancy text-graph
(<code>▁▃▅▇</code>) in the log.</li>
  <li>On stop, amplitude of output slides down over 1s to silence for a
smoother transition.</li>
  <li><code>sample_duration</code> now scales result based on current BPM.</li>
  <li><code>range</code> now accepts optional args: <code>inclusive:</code> and <code>step:</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gui-10">GUI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>German translation of GUI and tutorial. Simply open Sonic Pi with a
machine with a German localisation setting.</li>
  <li>Display GUI fully maximised when opening for first ever time.</li>
  <li>Workspace indexing now starts at 0 to match standard programming indexes.</li>
  <li>New shortcuts - <code>M-&lt;</code> and <code>M-&gt;</code> for switching workspaces.</li>
  <li>Many new Emacs-based code navigation and editing shortcuts. See the
shortcut cheatsheet in the built-in tutorial for more information.</li>

<h1 id="version-24---defrost">Version 2.4 - ‘Defrost’</h1>
<p><em>Wednesday 11th February, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.4.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>A quick release following <code>v2.3</code> to address an issue with the GUI
freezing on specific CPUs. However, although this release has had a
small development cycle, it ships with three fantastic features. Firstly
we now have the <code>spread</code> fn which provides an amazing way to create
interesting rhythms with very little code. Secondly we can now use
<code>cutoff:</code> on any sample massively increasing their timbral range and
finally we have three exciting new synths for you to play with. Have
fun!</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-10">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately 5 pre-release synths accidentally slipped into
v2.3. Three of them have been polished up and are in this release (one
with major changes including a name change). However, the other two
have been removed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-1">New</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New fn <code>spread</code> for creating rings of Euclidean distributions. Great
for quickly creating interesting rhythms.</li>
  <li>GUI now automatically appends a <code>:</code> to the FX opt autocomplete list  </li>
  <li>Synths and FX now raise an exception if any of their non-modulatable
opts are modulated. This is disabled when the pref ‘check synth
args’ is unchecked.</li>
  <li>GUI now renders pretty UTF-8 <code>└─</code> <code>├─</code> characters when printing in the log
on RP.</li>
  <li>Improve docstrings for sample player.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-8">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New Synth <code>:dark_ambience</code>, an ambient bass trying to escape the
darkness.</li>
  <li>New Synth <code>:hollow</code>, a hollow breathy sound.</li>
  <li>New Synth <code>:growl</code>, a deep rumbling growl.</li>
  <li>Sampler synths now sport built-in <code>rlpf</code> and <code>normaliser</code> FX. These
are disabled by default (i.e. won’t affect sound of the sample) and
can by enabled via the new <code>cutoff:</code>, <code>res:</code> and <code>norm:</code> opts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-4">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix insanely obscure bug which caused the GUI to freeze on certain
platforms (32 bit Windows and RP2 with 2G/2G kernel).</li>
  <li>Remove DC Bias offset from Prophet synth (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Wednesday 28th January, 2015</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.3.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-11">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Playing chords with the fn <code>chord</code> now divides the amplitude of each
resulting synth by the number of notes in the chord. This ensures the
resulting amplitude isn’t excessive and is normalised.</li>
  <li>Chords now evaluate their args once and those args are used for all
synth triggers. This means random values are only generated once and
are similar across all notes in the chord. Previous behaviour can be
obtained by calling play multiple times with no interleaved sleeps.</li>
  <li>Ensure each new thread’s random number generator is unique yet seeded
in a deterministic manner. This stops random vals across <code>at</code> from
being identical.</li>
  <li><code>range</code> is now exclusive: <code>(range 1, 5) #=&gt; (ring 1, 2, 3, 4)</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-2">New</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New fn <code>density</code> for compressing and repeating time Dr Who style. For
example, wrapping some code with a call to density of 2 will double
the bpm for that block as well as repeating it twice. This ensures the
block takes the same amount of time to execute while doing double the
work.</li>
  <li>New fns <code>with_bpm_mul</code> and <code>use_bpm_mul</code> which will multiply the
current bpm by a specified amount. Useful for slowing down and
speeding up the execution of a specific thread or live_loop.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>rdist</code> - generate a random number with a centred distribution</li>
  <li>New examples: <code>square skit</code>, <code>shufflit</code> and <code>tilburg</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-8">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Teach control to ignore nil nodes i.e. <code>control nil, amp: 3</code> will do
nothing.</li>
  <li>Teach Float#times to yield a float to the block. For example,
<code>3.4.times {|v| puts v}</code> will yield <code>0.0</code>, <code>1.0</code> and <code>2.0</code>.</li>
  <li>Synth, Sample and FX args now handle bools and nil correctly. <code>true</code>
resolves to <code>1.0</code> and <code>false</code>, <code>nil</code> resolve to <code>0.0</code>. This allows you
to write code such as: <code>play :e3, invert_wave: true</code></li>
  <li>Teach <code>at</code> to handle varying block arities differently. See docs for
more detail. Original behaviour is preserved and only extended.</li>
  <li>App now checks for updates (at most once every 2 weeks). This may be
disabled in the prefs.</li>
  <li>Teach <code>:reverb</code> FX to extend its kill delay time with larger room
sizes to reduce the chance of clipping.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-9">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New FX <code>bitcrusher</code> - for crunching and destroying those hi-fi sounds.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>flanger</code> - a classic swhooshing effect typically used with
vocals and guitars.</li>
  <li>New FX <code>ring</code> - ring modulation for that friendly Dalek sound</li>
  <li>New FX <code>bpf</code> - a band pass filter</li>
  <li>New FX <code>rbpf</code> - a resonant band pass filter</li>
  <li>New FX <code>nbpf</code> - a normalised band pass filter</li>
  <li>New FX <code>nrbpf</code> - a normalised resonant band pass filter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-samples">New Samples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>perc_snap</code> - a finger snap</li>
  <li><code>perc_snap2</code> - another finger snap</li>
  <li><code>bd_ada</code> - a bass drum</li>
  <li><code>guit_em9</code> - a lovely guitar arpeggio over Em9</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-5">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Namespace <code>live_loop</code> fn and thread names to stop them clashing with
standard user defined threads and fns.</li>
  <li>GUI no longer crashes when you start a line with a symbol.</li>
  <li><code>with_fx</code> now returns the result of the block</li>
  <li>Kill zombie scsynth servers on startup for better crash recovery.</li>
  <li>Handle paths with UTF8 characters gracefully</li>
  <li>Force sample rate for output and input to 44k on OS X. This stops
scsynth from crashing when output and input sample rates are
different.</li>

<h1 id="version-22---slicer">Version 2.2 - ‘Slicer’</h1>
<p><em>Thursday 18th December, 2014</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.2.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>This release brings a number of nice enhancements. However the main
feature is the accurate timing for triggering FX. This means you can now
reliably use FX for accurate rhythmic purposes such as wobbling, slicing
and echoes.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-12">Breaking Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>use_sample_pack_as</code> now uses a double underscore <code>__</code> as a separator
between the user-specified alias and the sample name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="api-changes">API Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Teach synth args to take prefixed maps: <code>play 50, {amp: 0.5}, {release: 2}, amp: 2</code></li>
  <li>Don’t round Floats when user specifically prints them to log with puts</li>
  <li><code>with_fx</code> FX synths are now triggered using virtual time rather than
real time. This means that FX can now be used for rhythmical purposes.</li>
  <li>Work on new <code>RingArray</code> datastructure. This is essentially an array
that wraps its indexes so you can use indexes larger than the array size.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>ring</code> - <code>(ring 1, 2, 3)</code> creates a new ring array.</li>
  <li>New fn <code>knit</code> - <code>(knit :a1, 2, :c1, 1)</code> returns <code>(ring :a1, :a1, :c1)</code></li>
  <li>New fn <code>bools</code> - <code>(bools 1, 0, 1)</code> returns <code>(ring true, false, true)</code></li>
  <li>New fn <code>range</code> - <code>(range 70, 100, 10)</code> returns <code>(ring 70, 80, 90, 100)</code></li>
  <li>New fn <code>sample_loaded?</code> - to detect whether a specific sample has been loaded</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synths--fx-10">Synths &amp; FX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed regression in <code>:tb303</code> synth - sound is reverted to v2.0 behaviour</li>
  <li>New Synth - <code>:square</code> - Pure square wave</li>
</ul>

  <li>On Raspberry Pi, previous volume and audio output options are forced
on boot.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-samples-1">New Samples</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>bd_tek</code> - Bass drum</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes-6">Bug fixes</h2>

<h1 id="version-21---core">Version 2.1 - ‘Core’</h1>
<p><em>Friday 21st November, 2014</em>
<a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.1.0">(view commits)</a></p>

<p>The focus of release is very much on technical improvements, efficiency
and general polish.</p>

<p>The most obvious and exciting change is the introduction of the
<code>live_loop</code> which will change the way you work with Sonic Pi. For more
information on <code>live_loop</code> take a look at the new section in the
tutorial. Another very exciting development is that v2.1 marks the
official support for Windows thanks to the excellent work by Jeremy
Weatherford. Finally, this release is also the first release where Sonic
Pi has a Core Team of developers. Please give a warm welcome to Xavier
Riley, Jeremy Weatherford and Joseph Wilk.</p>
